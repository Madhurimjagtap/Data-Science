# Python Program for cube sum of first n natural numbers
# Simple Python program to find sum of series with cubes of first n natural numbers

# Returns the sum of series
def sumOfSeries(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        sum += i * i * i

    return sum


# Input
n = 5
print(sumOfSeries(n))





# A formula based Python program to find sum
# of series with cubes of first n natural
# numbers

# Returns the sum of series
